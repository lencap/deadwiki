## 0.1.27-dev

- Nice error now shown when trying to create wiki page that already
  exists.
- Added navigation to `/jump` (`ctrl-j`) page.
- Fixed a bug with the 'jump' page displaying errors.
- Clicking "new" on a page in a directory will now pre-fill the "New
  Page" form with the current directory.

## 0.1.26

- Dark Mode CSS added. There's an icon in the UI.
- Added error message on 'Recently Edited' when wiki isn't in git.
- Added basic navigation to 'Recently Edited' page, too.

## 0.1.25

Small bugfix release:

- Fixed back/forward keybindings conflict in Firefox. #11
- Fixed fuzzy finder on "jump to" page (`ctrl-j`). #10

## 0.1.24

- deadwiki now uses [Hatter](https://github.com/xvxx/hatter) for its
  HTML templates. This should hopefully let us make the server-side
  rendered views a bit more interesting.
- A few JS keyboard shortcut bugfixes.
- Render time is now displayed in an HTML comment.
- Multiple sub-directories are now folded on the index page, beyond
  just the first.
- If an `index.md` file exists, it will be displayed instead of a wiki
  page list on the page page. (#8)
- There is now an `/all` route that will always display all wiki
  pages.
- Fix link creation to more closely match filenames. (#7)

## 0.1.23

- We've cut down the number of dependencies from **42** to **28**,
  shaving a few precious seconds off build time in the process.
- Windows line endings (`\r`) are now stripped from wiki page bodies
  on edit or create. We didn't want those in there.
- Double click JS events are gone. They got in the way of highlighting
  text and were annoying me when trying to copy and paste. You can use
  the `ctrl-e` keyboard shortcut to quickly jump to the edit page,
  instead.
- deadwiki will now serve non-Markdown files in your wiki, meaning
  local images are now supported! You'll have to add them to your
  wiki directory's structure manually for now, but we may add a simple
  drag-and-drop upload function for lazy folks (like me...) in the
  future.
- We've done a bit of internal refactoring. There may be (more) bugs.
- deadwiki pages are now case sensitive, just like most file systems.
- The `gui` feature has been removed. We may revisit it in the future,
  perhaps as a tray icon-style app, but for now I am using deadwiki as
  a "pinned tab" in my browser and it is pretty convenient. I'm more
  interested in a TUI than a WebView app at this point, as far as
  complementing the core web app goes.

**Dev notes:**

- deadwiki is evolving from a "web app" to a library that is wrapped
  by a web app. This means creating, finding, editing wiki pages,
  etc, is done in the `DB` module instead of directly in the HTTP
  routes. Besides being a nicer way to organize and test the code, it
  means we will be able to add a lightweight TUI in the future that
  works the same as the web app.
- Similarly, deadwiki is evolving from relying on Rust libraries to
  relying on UNIX commands. Our "search" is powered by `grep`, for
  example. My plan is to allow you to configure which commands are
  used for which actions, so you can easily swap in `ripgrep` for
  `grep` you'd like - without having to recompile deadwiki itself.

## 0.1.22

- Bugfix release.

## 0.1.21

- Added `i` keyboard shortcut to edit the current page.
- The "new" form now prefills the title with the current directory.
- Fixed `cargo install deadwiki`.

## 0.1.20

- "Recently edited pages" page added.
- "Jump to page" (`ctrl-j`) now lets you jump to `#hashtags`.
- "Jump to page" results can now be selected using
  `up`/`down`/`ctrl-n`/`ctrl-p` keyboard shortcuts.
- `make install` will build and install the `dead` binary to
  `$PREFIX/bin`, where `$PREFIX` defaults to `$HOME` (`~/bin`).

## 0.1.19

This is a small release that upgrades Vial, fixing a few minor bugs.

## 0.1.18

Jump-to-page via fuzzy finder is now live! Use `ctrl-j` to open the
menu and start typing a page title. This will gain functionality in
the future.

This release also switches deadwiki to a new backend,
[Vial](https://vial.sh). **Vial** is a micro micro-framework for Rust.
This change has cut the dependency count from 72 to 42 and release
compile time from ~22s to ~8s on my machine:

Enjoy!

## 0.1.17

This release adds support for #hashtags! Very simple: any #hashtag
in wiki content will get turned into a link that takes you to a
search page. The search page will display all the wiki pages that
include the hashtag.

Nothing fancy like searching for more than one hashtag at a time.
Just the basics. Enjoy!

## 0.1.16

Another small UI tweak: when the default page is empty, it gives you a
hint about what it's for.

## 0.1.15

This release adds a slight UI tweak - wiki pages in subdirectories are
now swaddled in `<details>`:

## 0.1.14

This release includes new keyboard shortcuts for browsing around the
wiki:

- `Ctrl-h`: Go to home page
- `Ctrl-e`: Open edit mode for the current wiki page
- `Ctrl-n`: Go to "create new wiki page" page

You can also double click on a wiki page to enter edit or create mode.

Enjoy!

## 0.1.13

- First release with a working GUI mode. Launch it by compiling with
  the `gui` feature and running deadwiki with `-g`:

  cargo run --features gui -- -g

If you don't pass a path to a wiki it'll pop up a "find directory"
dialog. Point to your wiki and get crackin!

Eventually this will (probably) be a menu bar application for macOS
and Linux.
